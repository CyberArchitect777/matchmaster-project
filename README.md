#  Match Master
## By Barrie Millar
### A Themed Memory Card Matching Game

## Introduction

This document is designed to cover the future maintenance of this repository. The original documentation for this project at the deadline can be found [here](https://github.com/CyberArchitect777/matchmaster-project/blob/main/README-MatchMaster.md).

## Repository/Project Maintenance

Match Master is a full stack project and thus depends on backend elements to remain functional. For this reason, future database or platform changes may require updates to keep it working. However, all changes made will be maintenance only and the project will not receive any functional changes to this repository. Any new endeavour changing this will appear in a new repository.

A tag and a branch have been created for this project with the label of v1.0 and release-v1.0 respectively. This is to mark the original project as submitted during the 16-Week High-Performance Full Stack Skills Bootcamp at Code Institute.

## Changes made

- Added new maintenance documentation in README.md to explain future updates. The original document was moved to README-MatchMaster.md.
- Added files to .gitignore to ignore more local workspace content. This is to facilitate development on Docker as well as the original GitPod.
- Added Dockerfile and changed access settings to allow local Docker development
